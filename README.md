# Halloween_Story
Choose your own adventure in this Halloween story, hope you have your popcorn! 

This project will take you through a story where you can choose your own adventure. Although we aren't advanced enough to build a form of UI, we added interactions with the user
using if statements and methods that take you back to the beginning if you choose to.

There are both happy and scary endings, so there should be something in here for everyone!

The program begins by setting the scene for the story, the main character , the user, is stuck in the woods and is forced to pick between three paths.
We asked for the user input using a scanner and then assigning the input to a method. For example, writing 'r' will lead the program to the rightPath method.

In the method, the user is once again presented with options, using if statements again to make the choices. 

If the user picks an option that causes the game to end, the user is prompted to choose if they want to play again, if they do, they're taken to the beginning of the game.

As a team, our coding experience was roughly the same, which is a month! We wanted to use a simple idea to convey a fun game
that could be enjoyed on Halloween. 

The thing that we used most actively were if statements that allowed us to give outputs for each choice the user made. 

We used a method to run each path in the beginning under the names leftPath, rightPath and mainPath. This allowed each member of the team to work on a method and then to put all of our
code together with ease. 

Under each path, we were free to write our own stories. We added at least one choice in each method to keep the user active and tried to come up with stories that would entertain the user.

As a team, the most important thing we learnt was how fun it was to actually implement the concepts we learnt into our code. We sometimes ran into issues while planning our statements, but with the help of mentors and other team members
we managed to pull through. 

We also struggled with learning GitHub, as beginners, most of us weren't even familiar with what it was until today but the tutorial gave us the basics we neeeded
and then afterwards we understood the fundamentals of GitHub, such as uploading the file, using pull requests with the help of the amazing mentors.

We hope you enjoy our project as much as we enjoyed making it!
